# aiReview

aiReview is an artificial intelligence-based system that creates a reviewer (in the form of a flashcard) from handwritten lecture notes. It uses optical character recognition (OCR) in converting an image of handwritten text into a machine-readable text file. Unlike other OCR software, it also features an annotation-conversion system that converts underlined words in the input with blanks and boxed words into bolded words.
